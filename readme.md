# Peloton (onepeloton.com) API Walk-through

This project contains a notebook that shows a simple walk-through of the Peloton API at onepeloton.com

The notebook shows the data fields available throughout the different API endpoints with the goal of pulling all of a user's workout performance data together in a tidy table (tibble) for further analysis or visualization. 

It also contains a python script that condenses the walk-through shown in the notebook into a more efficient form.
