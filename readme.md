# Peloton (onepeloton.com) API Walk-through

This project contains a notebook that shows a simple walk-through of the Peloton API at onepeloton.com

The notebook shows the data fields available throughout the different API endpoints with the goal of pulling all of a user's workout performance data together in a tidy table (tibble) for further analysis or visualization. However, this walkthrough uncovers all types of data that can be found at the API endpoint, for example user experience data.

It also contains a python script that condenses the walk-through shown in the notebook into a more efficient form that will create a tibble of all of a user's workout data.
